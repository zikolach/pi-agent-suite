# context-projection

## Purpose

- `context-projection` reduces provider context use in long sessions.
- It replaces old large, successful text tool results with a short omitted notice.
- It can include generated summaries for projected tool results when summary mode is enabled.

Projection is disabled until `enabled` is set to `true`.

## Configuration file

Primary file: `~/.pi/agent/agent-suite/context-projection/config.json`.

Compatibility file: `~/.pi/agent/config/context-projection.json`. This file is read only when the primary file is missing.

Full config example:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "projectCompactionSource": true,
  "projectionRemainingTokensL1": 70000,
  "minToolResultTokensL1": 4000,
  "projectionRemainingTokensL2": 50000,
  "minToolResultTokensL2": 2000,
  "projectionRemainingTokensL3": 30000,
  "minToolResultTokensL3": 1000,
  "keepRecentTurns": 10,
  "keepRecentTurnsPercent": 0.2,
  "projectionIgnoredTools": [],
  "omittedNotice": "Result omitted. Run tool again for full result.",
  "summaryNotice": "Full result omitted. Summary below. Run tool again for full result.",
  "summary": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": {
      "id": "summary",
      "thinking": "low"
    },
    "maxConcurrency": 1,
    "retryCount": 1,
    "retryDelayMs": 5000,
    "systemPromptFile": null,
    "userPromptFile": null
  }
}
```

All parameters are optional. Unknown parameters make the configuration invalid.

Breaking change: `placeholder` is removed. If the config contains `placeholder`, startup fails with a message that names `omittedNotice` and `summaryNotice`.

Enabled projection requires `custom-compaction` to resolve to a valid configuration with `enabled` not set to `false`. Missing custom-compaction configuration satisfies this requirement because custom compaction is enabled by default. An explicitly disabled or invalid custom-compaction configuration stops projection with an exact configuration error. `context-projection` never edits or automatically enables custom compaction.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type or shape | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | No | Boolean | Disabled when omitted or set to `false` | Enables projection. Set `true` to allow the extension to replace eligible old tool results. |
| `projectCompactionSource` | No | Boolean | `true` | Before custom compaction, generates missing summaries for eligible tool results in Pi's discarded range. `false` leaves results without existing summaries to Pi's standard 2,000-character truncation. |
| `projectionRemainingTokensL1` | No | Non-negative integer | `70000` | Defines the L1 threshold. When L1 is the deepest newly reached level, the extension applies one L1 batch. Must be greater than or equal to `projectionRemainingTokensL2`. |
| `minToolResultTokensL1` | No | Non-negative integer | `4000` | Minimum token count for a tool result to be projected at L1. |
| `projectionRemainingTokensL2` | No | Non-negative integer | `50000` | Defines the L2 threshold. When L2 is deeper than the applied level, the extension applies one L2 batch. Must be between L1 and L3. |
| `minToolResultTokensL2` | No | Non-negative integer | `2000` | Minimum token count for a tool result to be projected at L2. |
| `projectionRemainingTokensL3` | No | Non-negative integer | `30000` | Defines the L3 threshold. When L3 is deeper than the applied level, the extension applies one L3 batch. Must be less than or equal to `projectionRemainingTokensL2`. |
| `minToolResultTokensL3` | No | Non-negative integer | `1000` | Minimum token count for a tool result to be projected at L3. |
| `keepRecentTurns` | No | Non-negative integer | `10` | Minimum number of newest tool-use turns kept visible. A tool-use turn is an assistant tool call plus its matching tool results. |
| `keepRecentTurnsPercent` | No | Number from `0` to `1` | `0.2` | Fraction of newest tool-use turns kept visible in long sessions. The extension uses the larger value from `keepRecentTurns` and this percentage. |
| `projectionIgnoredTools` | No | Array of unique non-empty strings | `[]` | Tool names whose results stay visible. `consult_advisor`, `convene_council`, and tools whose names start with `workflow_` always stay visible during ordinary projection, even when omitted from this list. |
| `omittedNotice` | No | Non-empty string | `Result omitted. Run tool again for full result.` | Text that replaces projected tool results when summary mode is disabled or a summary cannot be used. |
| `summaryNotice` | No | Non-empty string | `Full result omitted. Summary below. Run tool again for full result.` | Text written in `<notice>` when a projected tool result includes a generated summary. |
| `summary` | No | Object | Summary disabled | Configures optional generated summaries for projected tool results. |

If multiple projection levels use the same remaining-token threshold, the extension activates the deepest matching level and uses the lowest matching `minToolResultTokens*` value.

## Threshold transitions

Before every provider request, the extension computes the active level from projection-aware remaining tokens. New projection discovery runs only when that level is deeper than the `appliedLevel` recorded after the latest successful compaction.

- The first L1, L2, or L3 transition creates one projection batch with that level's `minToolResultTokens*` value.
- A direct jump across multiple thresholds creates one batch at the deepest reached level.
- Usage moving above and below an applied threshold does not repeat that level.
- A crossed level is recorded even when no tool result is eligible.
- Existing replacements are replayed on every request without discovering new entries inside the applied level.
- Successful compaction resets the applied level. Session startup and tree navigation restore the selected branch's level from `context-projection` session entries.

This limits old provider-context changes to at most three batches between successful compactions. The checkpoint entry itself is extension state and is not sent in provider context.

## Effective context and replacement ordering

Provider requests use Pi's effective context: compaction-aware messages after Pi applies `context_edit` omission or replacement records. The extension maps each effective message to its raw source entry through Pi's public session projection, then applies repository projection replacements without rewriting stored history.

Replacement validity follows active-branch append order for each source entry:

1. A `context-projection` state record makes its replacement effective.
2. A later Pi `context_edit` for that source entry invalidates the repository replacement and restores Pi's effective omission or replacement.
3. A later `context-projection` state record can project that source entry again.

Runtime replacements that are not branch-visible yet follow the same ordering. A later branch edit or projection record controls the target, and switching to a branch without the runtime replacement's anchor discards that runtime state.

## Projection-aware usage

The footer, projection thresholds, and compaction trigger use one branch-aware usage calculation. It has two modes:

- **Response-based mode:** When the latest canonically visible usable assistant response is after the latest raw `context_edit` or compaction entry, native usage already reflects earlier effective projection. The calculation subtracts only effective projection savings recorded after that response.
- **Canonical-estimate mode:** When no canonically visible usable response follows the latest raw `context_edit` or compaction entry, Pi's native estimate can include content that effective projection removes. The calculation subtracts all effective active projection savings.

A usable response is a visible assistant response with positive usage that is neither an error nor aborted. Omitted assistant responses, zero usage, errors, and aborted responses do not select response-based mode. Unknown native token usage remains unknown, and numeric adjusted usage is clamped at zero.

## Summary parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type or shape | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary.enabled` | No | Boolean | `false` | Enables generated summaries for newly projected tool results. |
| `summary.model` | No | Object | Current main model and thinking level | Configures the model used to generate summaries. |
| `summary.model.id` | No | Non-empty string | Current main model | Accepts either `provider/model` or an alias from `model-aliases/config.json`. |
| `summary.model.thinking` | No | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` | Current thinking level | Thinking level used for summary requests. |
| `summary.maxConcurrency` | No | Positive integer | `1` | Maximum number of summary requests that can run at the same time. |
| `summary.retryCount` | No | Non-negative integer | `1` | Number of retry attempts after the first summary request fails. |
| `summary.retryDelayMs` | No | Non-negative integer | `5000` | Delay between summary retry attempts, in milliseconds. |
| `summary.systemPromptFile` | No | `null`, absolute path, or home-prefixed path | Bundled system prompt | Custom system prompt file for summary generation. `null` has the same effect as omitting the parameter. |
| `summary.userPromptFile` | No | `null`, absolute path, or home-prefixed path | Bundled user prompt | Custom user prompt file appended after the tool result text. `null` has the same effect as omitting the parameter. |

Home-prefixed paths accept `~`, `$HOME`, or `${HOME}`, either alone or followed by `/...`. Other environment variables are not expanded.

When `summary.enabled` is omitted or set to `false`, other summary values are ignored except unsupported summary keys.

Each tool-result summary candidate uses a Pi-compatible UUIDv7 provider session ID separate from the main agent session and other candidates. Retries for one candidate reuse that ID.

## Compaction source projection

When `projectCompactionSource` and `summary.enabled` are both `true`, custom compaction reuses existing projection summaries and generates missing summaries for every successful text tool result in `messagesToSummarize` and `turnPrefixMessages` whose size reaches `minToolResultTokensL3`.

This forced pass does not apply ordinary remaining-token triggers, recent-turn protection, loaded-skill protection, or ignored-tool protection. Pi has already selected these entries for removal, so the alternative is Pi's 2,000-character summary serialization rather than continued full visibility.

Generated summaries remain complete in the compaction source and are not passed through Pi's tool-result character limit. A failed, unavailable, non-reducing, or disabled projection summary falls back to Pi serialization for that result. Forced summaries are not persisted as projection state because successful compaction removes their source entries from the active context.

## Summary diagnostics

Each failed tool-result summary attempt appends a `tool-result-summary-diagnostic` custom entry to the JSONL session. Custom entries do not participate in model context.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | Extension that requested the summary: `context-projection` or `custom-compaction`. |
| `provider` | Summary model provider. |
| `model` | Summary model ID. |
| `candidateId` | Stable identifier of the tool result being summarized. |
| `toolName` | Tool that produced the result. |
| `attempt` | Failed attempt number, starting at `1`. |
| `totalAttempts` | Initial attempt plus configured retries. |
| `failureKind` | `context-too-large`, `aborted`, `provider-error`, `empty-response`, or `exception`. |
| `errorName` | Exception name when the provider call threw. |
| `errorCode` | String or numeric exception code when available. |
| `errorMessage` | Single-line failure message, limited to 2,000 characters. |

Diagnostic entries never contain prompts, tool-result text, authentication data, request headers, or exception stacks. A diagnostic persistence failure does not change summary retry or fallback behavior.

## Usage notes

- Missing configuration keeps projection disabled.
- Most invalid projection settings disable projection. Non-absolute summary prompt paths, invalid projection level ordering, removed `placeholder`, and an invalid or disabled `custom-compaction` dependency stop startup.
- Projection only changes the provider context for the current request. It does not rewrite stored session messages.
- Live custom messages can map to persisted `custom_message` entries when only their timestamps differ. Differences in role, custom type, content, display, or details make mapping fail safe without projection.
- Adaptive compaction reuses recorded summary replacements in its discarded range and can generate missing L3 summaries before building the durable summary source. Omission-only replacements are never used as durable summary input.
- Only successful text tool results can be projected.
- Failed tool results, non-text tool results, ignored tools, tool results protected by `keepRecentTurns` or `keepRecentTurnsPercent`, and `read` results for files under loaded skill directories stay visible.
- Keep `omittedNotice` and `summaryNotice` short because the model sees them in provider context.
- Enable `summary` when omitted results remove information that the model still needs.
