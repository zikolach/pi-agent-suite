# system-prompt

## Purpose

`system-prompt` replaces pi's base system prompt with a Markdown template. The template can include runtime values such as the current date, working directory, tool guidelines, deferred-toolset triggers, and loaded project context. Tool names, descriptions, and parameter schemas reach the model through the provider tool payload instead of the template.

## Configuration

Default config file: `~/.pi/agent/agent-suite/system-prompt/config.json`.

Full config example:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "templateFile": "/absolute/path/to/system.md"
}
```

Parameters:

| Name | Type or shape | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Boolean | No | `true` | Enables this extension. Set to `false` to keep pi's original system prompt. |
| `templateFile` | Absolute or home-prefixed file path string | No | Bundled system prompt template | Markdown template file used as the system prompt. Plain relative paths are rejected. |

Home-prefixed paths accept `~`, `$HOME`, or `${HOME}`, either alone or followed by `/...`. Other environment variables are not expanded.

Only these parameters are accepted.

If the config file is missing, the extension uses the bundled system prompt template. If the config file is invalid or the template file cannot be read, pi keeps its original system prompt.

## Template variables

Use variables in the template as `{{variableName}}`. Whitespace inside braces is allowed, such as `{{ date }}`.

Supported variables:

| Variable | Inserts |
| --- | --- |
| `{{date}}` | Local date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. |
| `{{cwd}}` | Current working directory with `/` path separators. |
| `{{toolsets}}` | Eligible deferred toolsets as `<toolsets>` XML, one `<toolset name="…" description="…"/>` per entry. It is empty when none are eligible. Attribute values XML-escape `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'`. |
| `{{toolGuidelines}}` | Prompt guidelines supplied by active tools or extensions, one bullet per normalized guideline. Surrounding whitespace is removed and the first occurrence of a duplicate is retained. |
| `{{appendSystemPrompt}}` | Text passed through pi append-system-prompt inputs. |
| `{{contextFiles}}` | Loaded context files inside `<project_specific_instructions>` XML-style blocks. |
| `{{skills}}` | Loaded skills formatted by pi when the `read` tool is active. |

Unsupported variables are removed from the rendered prompt. `{{toolsets}}` is expanded only where the template contains it: a custom template that omits it receives no trigger catalog. Before values are built, active tools are reconciled; the catalog contains only loaded, still-deferred toolsets with at least one tool allowed for the current agent. Registered tools activated by other extensions after startup remain available on later turns unless a current agent or toolset policy excludes them. Observed external deactivation is respected. Deactivation of a tool already hidden by policy cannot be observed through Pi's active-tool list; an explicit owner replacement can still retire that tool.
