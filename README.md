**Supported Pi version: Pi 0.87.x**

## Quick start

### 1. Install extensions package using pi

```bash
pi install npm:pi-agent-suite
```

### 2. Copy demo agent and workflow files to your local Pi configuration

Copy [Demo configuration files](https://github.com/n-r-w/pi-agent-suite/blob/main/docs/examples/agent-suite) to `~/.pi/agent/agent-suite`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/agent-suite
curl -fsSL https://github.com/n-r-w/pi-agent-suite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip | bsdtar -xf- --strip-components=4 -C ~/.pi/agent/agent-suite pi-agent-suite-main/docs/examples/agent-suite
```

### 3. Test it

1. Start Pi in a project directory.
2. Select the `Coder` agent with `/agent` or `Ctrl+Alt+A`.
3. Ask the agent about available subagents and workflows, for example: "What subagents, advisors, and workflows tools are available? How can you use them to solve a task? Give a very brief summary."

Expected response:
```md
- **Subagents**
  - `SubAgentAnalyst`: research, analysis, reviews, architecture, specifications, and planning. No coding.
  - `SubAgentExtractor`: fast, accurate extraction of raw information. No analysis or business-logic interpretation.
  - I can start, steer, query, and wait for subagent sessions. Independent tasks can run in parallel.

- **Advisor**
  - `consult_advisor`: provides an independent second opinion on a focused question. It cannot access tools.

- **Workflows**
  - `Coding`: ready-made workflow for complex coding tasks.
  - I can activate it and transition through its allowed stages.
  - If no workflow fits, I can create a task-specific, staged workflow with advance and rework paths.

**Typical use:** activate a suitable workflow, gather evidence directly or through an extractor, delegate focused analysis to an analyst, consult the advisor for a second opinion when valuable, then complete and verify each workflow stage in order.
```
4. Ask the agent `Try running each subagent to see how it works.`, type `Ctrl+Alt+S` or /subagents to open the subagent management screen, and see how the subagents run in parallel and return results.

## What key problems does Pi Agent Suite solve?

### Different tasks require unique combinations of rules, available tools, models, and reasoning levels

Solution: an agent system in which each agent can be configured for a specific task.

#### Management commands

Select the current active agent (a list of all agents with the `main` type is available):
- Command `/agent`
- Key binding `Ctrl+Alt+A`

Open the UI for managing running agents:
- Command `/subagents`
- Key binding `Ctrl+Alt+S`

![Full subagents TUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n-r-w/pi-agent-suite/main/docs/images/subagents-tui.png)

#### Available tools

- `subagent_start` - starts an available agent and returns a unique session identifier. The agent continues running in the background and can return a response either through `subagent_wait` or when its work is complete
- `subagent_steer` - sends a message to an existing agent session
- `subagent_wait` - waits for one of several active agent sessions to finish and returns the result of the first agent that completes
- `subagent_query` - allows the model to call an agent and ask it a follow-up question without affecting its session.

#### Creating agents

Agent file location: `~/.pi/agent/agent-suite/agent-selection/agents/<agent_name>.md`

- `description` - the agent description, which will be:
    - displayed in the user interface when selecting an agent with the `main` type
    - added to the context for agents with the `subagent` and `both` types
- `type` - the agent type:
    - `main` - an agent that can be called directly by the user but cannot be called by other agents
    - `subagent` - an agent that can be called only by other agents and is not directly available to the user
    - `both` - an agent that can be called by both the user and other agents
- `model` - the model used by the agent. Parameters:
    - `id` - model identifier (`provider/model`) or alias from `model-aliases/config.json`.
    - `thinking` - model reasoning level (low, medium, high).
- `tools` - the list of tools the agent can use to solve a task.
    - The `*` wildcard is allowed.
    - If the tools field is omitted, the agent will use all available tools.
    - If `tools: []` is set, no tools will be available.
- `agents` - the list of child agents that the agent can call while working.
    - Access to `subagent_*` tools is required.
    - If the agents field is omitted, the agent will not be able to call any other agents with the `subagent` or `both` type.
    - If `agents: []` is set, subagents will be unavailable.
- `workflows` (optional) - the list of workflows the agent can use to solve a task.
    - Access to `workflow_*` tools is required.
    - If the workflows field is omitted, the agent will not be able to use any workflows.
    - If `workflows: []` is set, workflows will be unavailable.

Example agent configuration file (Markdown):

```markdown
description: Reviews code and checks implementation risks.
type: main
model:
  id: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol
  thinking: high
tools: ["consult_advisor", "convene_council", "subagent_*", "workflow_*", "read", "bash", "edit", "write", "grep", "find", "ls"]
agents: ["Extractor", "CodeSlopFinder"]
workflows: ["CodeReview"]
---
You are a code review agent. Check correctness, risks, and missing validation.
Use subagents to help you with the review.
Use `CodeReview` workflow to structure your process.
```

#### General agent system configuration (optional)

File: `~/.pi/agent/agent-suite/run-subagent/config.json`

#### General configuration examples

Minimum config example: the configuration file can be omitted entirely, in which case the default values will be used.

Full config example:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "maxDepth": 2,
  "extensionDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/to/subagents-rules.md",
  "startDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/to/subagent-start.md",
  "steerDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/to/subagent-steer.md",
  "waitDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/to/subagent-wait.md",
  "query": {
    "model": {
      "id": "openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol",
      "thinking": "medium"
    },
    "systemPromptFile": "/absolute/path/to/subagent-query-system.md"
  }
}
```

### The model must be reliably kept on track rather than simply relying on a complex multi-step prompt

Solution: the ability to create workflows represented by a graph of stages, each of which can be completed by a subagent.

![Workflow TUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n-r-w/pi-agent-suite/main/docs/images/tui-compact.png)

#### Available tools

- `workflow_activate` - activates an available workflow and places it in the model context.
- `workflow_transition` - transitions between stages of the active workflow.
- `workflow_create` - allows the model to create a custom workflow. It exists only in the context of the current session, is not saved to disk, and is activated immediately after creation.

#### Workflow structure

- Base prompt. It remains in the context and applies to all workflow stages.
- Stages. One initial stage and any number of intermediate and final stages are allowed.
- Stage prompt. It remains in the context only during that stage and does not clutter it with irrelevant requirements.
- Transition type between stages. It can be either `advance` (move forward) or `rework` (return for revision).

### Example workflow configuration file (YAML)

```yaml
description: Use for read-only inspection of code and technical artifacts
prompt: |-
  1. Do not modify inspected files.
  2. Inspect only permitted scope.
  3. Apply relevant skills, patterns, exclusions, and output format.
  4. Support every reported finding or recommendation with inspected evidence.
stages:
  - id: define_scope
    description: Define inspection scope
    prompt: |-
      1. Determine files, changes, modules, or repository areas permitted by scope rules.
      2. Identify excluded generated code and out-of-scope artifacts.
      3. Stop and request clarification when inspection scope cannot be determined safely.
    initial: true
  - id:  load_rules
    description: Load inspection rules
    prompt: |-
      1. Load every relevant skill and project rules.
      2. Identify patterns, invariants, and exclusions that define a valid finding.
  - id: inspect_artifacts
    description: Inspect code and technical artifacts
    prompt: |-
      1. Inspect permitted scope systematically.
      2. Include configuration, build scripts, and other technical artifacts when allowed by scope rules.
      3. Record evidence and source locations for candidate findings.
  - id: verify_findings
    description: Verify findings are valid and material
    prompt: |-
      1. Verify each candidate against project behavior, rules, and context.
      2. Remove duplicate, speculative, insignificant, or out-of-scope findings.
      3. Confirm that every recommendation preserves required behavior when scope rules require behavior preservation.
      4. Return to inspection when evidence is incomplete.
  - id: report_findings
    description: Deliver findings using required format
    prompt: |-
      1. Report only findings permitted by scope rules.
      2. Include required source locations, evidence, impact, and recommendations.
      3. Deliver result through required channel.
      4. Return to inspection when parent feedback requires additional analysis.
    final: true
transitions:
  - from: define_scope
    to:  load_rules
    type: advance
  - from:  load_rules
    to: inspect_artifacts
    type: advance
  - from: inspect_artifacts
    to: verify_findings
    type: advance
  - from: verify_findings
    to: report_findings
    type: advance
  - from: verify_findings
    to: inspect_artifacts
    type: rework
  - from: report_findings
    to: inspect_artifacts
    type: rework
  - from: report_findings
    to: define_scope
    type: rework
```

Every workflow requires:
- one initial stage and at least one final stage
- non-empty stage IDs without spaces, tabs, line breaks, or other Unicode whitespace
- single-line workflow and stage descriptions
- a non-empty `prompt` for every stage
- an optional root `prompt` for guidance that applies to every stage
- unique stage IDs and valid transition endpoints
- an acyclic `advance` graph in which every stage is reachable
- no outgoing `advance` from final stages
- at least one outgoing `advance` from non-final stages
- `rework` transitions only to strict `advance` ancestors

#### Workflow system configuration (optional)

Allows the system prompts for `workflow_*` tools to be replaced with custom prompts.
```json
{
  "extensionDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/extension-description.md",
  "createDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/create-description.md",
  "activateDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/activate-description.md",
  "transitionDescriptionPromptFile": "/absolute/path/transition-description.md"
}
```

### Long sessions inevitably cause context window overflow and degradation during compaction

Solution: dynamic context compression that compresses large tool call results without significantly degrading reasoning quality. Compression occurs in several stages, gradually lowering the minimum size threshold for tool call results that are subject to compression.

### Configuration

Configuration file: `~/.pi/agent/agent-suite/context-projection/config.json`.

Parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Type or shape | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | No | Boolean | `false` | Enables projection |
| `projectCompactionSource` | No | Boolean | `true` | Before custom compaction, generates missing summaries for eligible tool results in Pi's discarded range. `false` leaves results without existing summaries to Pi's standard 2,000-character truncation. |
| `projectionRemainingTokensL1` | No | Non-negative integer | `70000` | Starts L1 projection when remaining context tokens are at or below this value. Must be greater than or equal to `projectionRemainingTokensL2`. |
| `minToolResultTokensL1` | No | Non-negative integer | `4000` | Minimum token count for a tool result to be projected at L1. |
| `projectionRemainingTokensL2` | No | Non-negative integer | `50000` | Starts L2 projection when remaining context tokens are at or below this value. Must be between L1 and L3. |
| `minToolResultTokensL2` | No | Non-negative integer | `2000` | Minimum token count for a tool result to be projected at L2. |
| `projectionRemainingTokensL3` | No | Non-negative integer | `30000` | Starts L3 projection when remaining context tokens are at or below this value. Must be less than or equal to `projectionRemainingTokensL2`. |
| `minToolResultTokensL3` | No | Non-negative integer | `1000` | Minimum token count for a tool result to be projected at L3. |
| `keepRecentTurns` | No | Non-negative integer | `10` | Minimum number of newest tool-use turns kept visible. A tool-use turn is an assistant tool call plus its matching tool results. |
| `keepRecentTurnsPercent` | No | Number from `0` to `1` | `0.2` | Fraction of newest tool-use turns kept visible in long sessions. The extension uses the larger value from `keepRecentTurns` and this percentage. |
| `projectionIgnoredTools` | No | Array of unique non-empty strings | `[]` | Tool names whose results stay visible. `consult_advisor` and `convene_council` always stay visible, even when omitted from this list. |
| `omittedNotice` | No | Non-empty string | `Result omitted. Run tool again for full result.` | Text that replaces projected tool results when summary mode is disabled or a summary cannot be used. |
| `summaryNotice` | No | Non-empty string | `Full result omitted. Summary below. Run tool again for full result.` | Text written in `<notice>` when a projected tool result includes a generated summary. |
| `summary` | No | Object | Summary disabled | Configures optional generated summaries for projected tool results. |

If multiple projection levels use the same remaining-token threshold, the extension uses the lowest matching `minToolResultTokens*` value for those levels.

Summary parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Type or shape | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary.enabled` | No | Boolean | `false` | Enables generated summaries for newly projected tool results. |

| `summary.maxConcurrency` | No | Positive integer | `1` | Maximum number of summary requests that can run at the same time. |
| `summary.retryCount` | No | Non-negative integer | `1` | Number of retry attempts after the first summary request fails. |
| `summary.retryDelayMs` | No | Non-negative integer | `5000` | Delay between summary retry attempts, in milliseconds. |
| `summary.systemPromptFile` | No | `null` or absolute file path | Bundled system prompt | Custom system prompt file for summary generation |
| `summary.userPromptFile` | No | `null` or absolute file path | Bundled user prompt | Custom user prompt file appended after the tool result text |

    "retryDelayMs": 5000,
    "systemPromptFile": null,
    "userPromptFile": null
  }
}
```

### Models tend to trust what they do and need an independent mechanism to verify their actions and results

Solution: give the model access to an advisor that receives the full current context and can independently evaluate the model's actions and results.

The `consult_advisor` tool is available. It has its own system prompt and accepts a question formulated by the model.
Models with a high reasoning level are recommended.

#### Configuration parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type or shape | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | No | Boolean | `true` | Enables or disables the `consult_advisor` tool |
| `model` | No | Object with optional `id` and `thinking` fields | Current session model and current thinking level | Selects the advisor model settings. |
| `model.id` | No | Non-empty string in `provider/model` format | Current session model | Selects the model used by the advisor. |
| `model.thinking` | No | One of `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` | Current thinking level | Selects the advisor thinking level. |
| `promptFile` | No | Non-empty absolute file path | Bundled advisor prompt | Uses a custom advisor prompt file |
| `retry` | No | Object with optional `enabled`, `maxRetries`, and `baseDelayMs` fields | Retry defaults | Controls retry behavior for retryable advisor provider failures. |
| `retry.enabled` | No | Boolean | `true` | Enables or disables retries. |
| `retry.maxRetries` | No | Non-negative integer | `3` | Sets the maximum number of retry attempts. |
| `retry.baseDelayMs` | No | Non-negative integer | `2000` | Sets the base retry delay in milliseconds. |
| `debugPayloadFile` | No | Non-empty absolute or relative file path | Not set | Writes the advisor request payload to this file for troubleshooting. Relative paths are resolved from the directory that contains `config.json`. |

#### Configuration examples

Minimum config example: the configuration file can be omitted entirely, in which case the default values will be used.

Full configuration example:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "model": {
    "id": "provider/model",
    "thinking": "high"
  },
  "promptFile": "absolute/path/to/advisor-prompt.md",
  "retry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "baseDelayMs": 2000
  },
  "debugPayloadFile": "./debug/consult-advisor-payload.json"
}
```

### Solving complex problems requires discussion

Solution: give the model access to a council of experts that discusses the problem and reaches a shared solution.

The `convene_council` tool is available. It has its own system prompt and accepts a question formulated by the model.
In addition, `convene_council` receives the current session context packaged as a file that the council can read.
Unlike `consult_advisor`, council members have access to any tools. They can read files, run Bash commands, and so on.
The council consists of two members who can be selected from the list of available models.
Models with a high reasoning level are recommended.

## MCP support and recommended MCP servers

These MCP servers can significantly improve overall efficiency (they require separate installation before use):
  - `https://github.com/n-r-w/team-mcp` for collaboration desks between agents.
  - `https://github.com/n-r-w/asteria` for symbolic code search.

To use MCP servers, add them to the `agent-suite/mcp-wrapper/config.json` extension configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "team": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "team-mcp"
    },
    "asteria": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "asteria-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
